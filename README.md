# COVID-SQL-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

# Project Description
This analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of COVID-19 through data-driven insights, examining patterns in case counts, vaccination rates, and other critical metrics across various regions.

* Data Sources: The analysis leverages publicly available data from:

  * Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID-19 Data
  * Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset
  
* Objectives:

  * Analyze trends in infection, recovery, and death rates.
  * Assess the impact and effectiveness of vaccination campaigns globally.
  * Compare responses and outcomes across different countries and regions.
 
* Tools Used:

  * SQL for data querying and aggregation.
  * Python (optional) for advanced data manipulation and visualization.
